Installation
------------
See [install.md](install.md)

Configuration
------------

Very little configuration is needed.

* In server.conf (/usr/local/etc/openvpn/server.conf)
* * You most likely want to change push routes.
* * You might want to change ip range "server" to something unique.
* * You might want to change default gateway for clients and push some dns servers if you want all traffic to go through the VPN.
* In config.php (/usr/local/www/apache24/data/config.php)
* * You might want to adjust the SSL_VALID time, its set to 2 years now.
* * You might want to set a specific hostname for client configurations, VPN_SERVER, but its automatically the vms hostname.
* * You can change language to swedish (for now) for the webgui.
* * You can set the strength used for new keys by changing the private_key_bits to 2048 or whatever (default is 4096)
